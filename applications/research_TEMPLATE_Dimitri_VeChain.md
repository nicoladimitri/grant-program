# VeChain grant research proposal template

## TITLE
   The Economics of VeChain

## Applicants
(Mr) Nicola Dimitri (the only applicant) 

Professor of Economics, Department of Economics and Statistics, University of Siena, Piazza San Francesco 7, 53100 Siena-Italy. For completeness below I insert my CV from which you can evince my profile and experience. As you can see, my main recent research interests are in game theory, auctions and their applications, blockchain and cryptocurrencies. For your perusal, in the CV I highlighted in yellow the activities/publications which are closer to the blockchain/cryptocurrencies fields. I would also like to add that I’m recently being involved in other blockchain based-projects, not yet included in the CV.  
Let me also notice I am currently Associate Editor of the journals “Frontiers in Blockchain” and “IET Blockchain”.  

## Payment Address

"352VQpTpmYft2MBcvy2wQp9utx9dj4RRYX"

## Summary

The project will consist of one paper where I aim to explore in details the economic implications of the two (currencies) tokens, VET and VTHO, in the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) based VeChain platform. From an economic perspective I find the VeChain monetary system particularly interesting since it exhibits some similarity, for example, to economic systems with one legal currency circulating together with another, non-legal, currency which is adopted by the population for price stability reasons. In particular, in the project I would set up an economic model where the preferences of a representative agent for holding the two currencies, and obtaining rewards, are considered. The analysis would provide insights for understanding the dynamics of the main variables of double currency system.       $3x+4$
